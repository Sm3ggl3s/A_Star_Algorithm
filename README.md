- **Misplaced Tiles**

## Introduction

The 8-puzzle consists of a 3Ã—3 grid with numbered tiles and one empty space (represented as 0). The goal is to rearrange the tiles to match a given goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space. The A* search algorithm is used to efficiently find the optimal solution.

--- 

## How it Works

1. The user provides:
    - An **initial state** (starting configuration of the board).
    - A **goal state** (desired configuration).
2. The A* algorithm searches for the optimal solution using two heuristics:
   - **Manhattan Distance**: The sum of the distances of each tile from its goal position.
   - **Misplaced Tiles**: The number of tiles not in their correct position.
3. If a solution exists, the program prints the sequence of moves and the board states leading to the goal.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or greater

### Running the program

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sm3ggl3s/A_Star_Algorithm.git
   cd A_Star_Algorithm
    ```
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Enter the board states as space-separated values (use `0` for the blank space).

Example input: 
```
Enter the initial state of the board (use a zero to represent the blank):1 2 3 4 0 5 6 7 8

Enter the goal state of the board (use a zero to represent the blank):1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0
```

### Code Explanation

#### Main Script (`main.py`)

- `get_user_input()`: Prompts the user to enter the initial state and goal state.
- Calls the A algorithm* twice using:
    - **Manhattan Distance heuristics**
    - **Misplaced Tiles heuristic**
- `print_solution(solution)`: Displays the sequence of moves and the board states leading to the goal

#### A* Algorithm (`a_star.py`)
- `a_star(initial_state, goal_state, heuristic)`:
    - Implements the A* search algorithm.
    - Uses a **priority queue** (`heapq`) to explore the most promising nodes first.
    - Expands valid neighboring states based on possible moves.
    - Returns the **solution path** if the goal state is found.

#### Puzzle Handling (`puzzle.py`)
- `Puzzle` Class:
    - Represents the **current state** of the puzzle.
    - Stores information about:
        - `board` -> Current configuration of the puzzle.
        - `goal_state` -> Target configuration
        - `parent` -> Previous state (for backtracing)
        - `move` -> Action taken to reach this state.
        - `depth` -> Number of moves made so far
        - `cost` -> Evaluation function `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
- `get_user_input()`:
    - Asks the user to input the initial and goal states.
- `move_tile(board, move, blank_index)`:
    - Moves the blank tile(`0`) in a given direction (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`).
    - Returns a new board configuration.
